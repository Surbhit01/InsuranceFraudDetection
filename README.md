# Insurance Fraud Detection

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To build a classification methodology to determine whether a customer is placing a fraudulent insurance claim or not based on multiple parameters.

## APPROACH
* The dataset with 37 features like months as customer, umbrella limit, education level, no of dependents etc were analyzed.<br>
* Based on the analysis, variables which seemed important for the prediction were considered for analysis.<br>
* Hyper parameter tuning was done on multiple algorithms like Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost and Random Forest Classifer and the model was built using the best performing parameters.
